# authorize-job-resource

A [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/) resource to only allow specified GitHub users and/or teams to run a job within
a Concourse pipeline.

This resource builds off of the work
in [karthikraina32/concourse-trigger-guard](https://github.com/karthikraina32/concourse-trigger-guard).

## Source Configuration

* `organization`: *Required.* The name of the organization to authorize users and/or teams under.
* `teams`: *Optional.* A list of teams to authorize within the given organization. Required if `users` is not specified.
* `users`: *Optional.* The name of the user to authorize. Required if `teams` is not specified.
* `access_token`: *Required.* A GitHub token with `read:org` scope if using GHEC. Use `admin:org` scope if using with GHES.
* `ghe_host`: *Optional.* The hostname of the GitHub Enterprise instance to communicate with the GitHub API.
* `suffix`: *Optional.* A suffix to append to the `$BUILD_CREATED_BY` metadata environment variable. This is useful when
  using GitHub Enterprise Cloud and your company appends a suffix to the username.

### Source Example

Note that `expose_build_created_by: true` is required for this resource to function properly. It exposes the
`$BUILD_CREATED_BY` metadata environment variable to the resource.

```yaml
resource_types:
  - name: authorize-job-resource
    type: docker-image
    source:
      repository: leojones/authorize-job-resource
      tag: latest

resources:
  # NORMAL USAGE
  - name: authorize-job
    type: authorize-job
    expose_build_created_by: true
    source:
      org: my-org
      users:
        - my-user
      teams:
        - my-team
      access_token: ((github-access-token))
  # GITHUB ENTERPRISE USAGE
  - name: authorize-job-ghe
    type: authorize-job
    expose_build_created_by: true
    source:
      ghe_host: github.mycompany.com
      org: my-org
      users:
        - my-user
      teams:
        - my-team
      access_token: ((github-access-token))
  # GITHUB ENTERPRISE CLOUD USAGE WITH SUFFIX
  - name: authorize-job-ghec-suffix
    type: authorize-job
    expose_build_created_by: true
    source:
      suffix: _mycompany
      org: my-org
      users:
        - my-user
      teams:
        - my-team
      access_token: ((github-access-token))
```


## Behavior

This resource is intended to be used as a `put` resource. It will authorize the specified users and/or teams to run a
job within a Concourse pipeline.

### `check`: No-Op

### `in`: No-Op

### `out`: Authorize Users and/or Teams

Authorize the specified users and/or teams to run a job within a Concourse pipeline.

#### Put Parameters

* `debug`: *Optional.* Enable debug logging. Defaults to `false`.

#### Put Example

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: my-job
    plan:
      - put: authorize-job
        params:
          debug: true
      - ... # the rest of the job plan
```

## Testing

The project uses [`bash_unit`](https://github.com/pgrange/bash_unit) to run tests.

### Running Tests

- a single test: `bash_unit tests/out.sh`
- all tests: `bash_unit tests/*`
- a specific test: `bash_unit -p test_validates_gh_user tests/out.sh`

### Testing Resources

- [how to mock in bash tests](https://advancedweb.hu/how-to-mock-in-bash-tests/)
- [example bash tests in the git resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource/tree/master/test)

### Running Locally

You can run the scripts locally by passing a valid expected Concourse payload.

For example, the following script will run the `out.sh` script and pass in a payload to validate team membership.

```bash
script_location="./../assets/out"
test_user='<test_user>'
payload='{"params":{"debug": "true"},"source":{"access_token":"<access_token>","org":"<org>","users":[],"teams":["<team>"]}}'
result=$(BUILD_CREATED_BY=$test_user BUILD_JOB_NAME="test-build-job" $script_location "$payload")
exit_code=$?
echo "actual result: $result"
echo "exit code: $exit_code"
```

## Implementation Details

Below are implementation details that impact the behavior of this resource.

### `$BUILD_CREATED_BY`

The resource relies on
the [`$BUILD_CREATED_BY`](https://concourse-ci.org/implementing-resource-types.html#resource-metadata)
metadata exposed by Concourse to resources.

This metadata environment variable exposes the username of the user that triggered the build. The resource uses this
username to determine if the user is authorized to run the job. If the username provided to the resource does not match
the username of the user that triggered the build, the resource will fail.

Ensure that your Concourse instance provides user's GitHub username as the `$BUILD_CREATED_BY` metadata environment.

### GitHub Enterprise Cloud Username

This resource supports GitHub, GitHub Enterprise Server, and GitHub Enterprise Cloud. When using with GitHub Enterprise
Cloud you may need to modify the username. For example, your company may append a suffix to the username to avoid
conflicts. If the `$BUILD_CREATED_BY` value does not include this suffix you can use the `suffix` parameter to modify
the username.
