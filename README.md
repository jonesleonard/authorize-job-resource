## Behavior

This resource is intended to be used as a `put` resource. It will authorize the specified users and/or teams to run a
job within a Concourse pipeline.

### `check`: No-Op

### `in`: No-Op

### `out`: Authorize Users and/or Teams

Authorize the specified users and/or teams to run a job within a Concourse pipeline.

#### Put Example

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: my-job
    plan:
      - put: authorize-job
      - ... # the rest of the job plan
```

## Implementation Details

The resource authorizes users and/or teams to run a job within a GitHub organization. It relies on
the [`$BUILD_CREATED_BY`](https://concourse-ci.org/implementing-resource-types.html#resource-metadata) metadata
environment variable that concourse uses to expose the username of the user that triggered the build.
